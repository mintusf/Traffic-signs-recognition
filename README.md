# Traffic-signs-recognition
The program utilizes tensorflow framework to build a scalable Deep Neural Network to recognize 43 different traffic signs. Its accuracy with cross validation set is equal 90%. Original dataset is available at https://www.kaggle.com/valentynsichkar/traffic-signs-preprocessed#label_names.csv. Algorithm implements batch normalization, learning rate decay and dropout. For cost function minimization it uses minibatch Adam optimizer.
